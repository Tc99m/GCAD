This repository contains the official code for the AAAI-25 paper:
*GCAD: Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series from the Perspective of Granger Causality*
In this paper, we designed a framework that models spatial dependencies using interpretable causal relationships and detects anomalies through **changes in causal patterns**. Specifically, we propose a method to dynamically discover Granger causality effects using gradients in nonlinear deep predictors and employ a simple sparsification strategy to obtain a Granger causality graph, detecting anomalies from a causal perspective.
